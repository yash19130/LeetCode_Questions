<div class="problem-statement">
                <p></p><p><span style="font-size:18px">Geek hosted a contest and <strong>N</strong> students participated in it. The score of each student is given by an integer array <strong>arr[]</strong>. The task is to print the number of each student (indexes) in the order they appear on the scoreboard.<br>
A student with a maximum score appears first. If two people have the same score then a higher indexed student appears first.<br>
<br>
<strong>Example 1:</strong></span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input:
</strong>N = 5
arr[] = {450, 230, 730, 230, 150}
<strong>Output:
</strong>3 1 4 2 5
<strong>Explanation:
</strong>1. The top scorer is at 3<sup>rd</sup> index, therefore 3 
at the first index.
2. The second-highest scorer is at 1<sup>st</sup> index therefore
 1 is at the second index.
3. The third-highest scorer is at 4<sup>th</sup> index therefore
 4 at the thirst index.

</pre>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Example 2:</strong></span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input:
</strong>N = 3
arr[] = {500, 500, 500}
<strong>Output:
</strong>3 2 1
</span>
</pre>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Your Task:</strong><br>
This is a full problem. You need to write the complete code.<br>
1. The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of&nbsp;T test cases follows.<br>
2. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.<br>
3. The next line contains N space-separated integers.</span><br>

<strong>Constraints:</strong><br>
2 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>5</sup><br>
1 ≤ cost[i] ≤ 10<sup>4</sup></span></p>
